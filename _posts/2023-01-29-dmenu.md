## Dmenu
dmenu is a dynamic menu for X, originally designed for dwm by [suckless.org](https://suckless.org). It manages large numbers of user-defined menu items efficiently.

### Install
You can install dmenu from your linux distro repositories, but the problem is that you wont be able to customize or patch it, so you need to source it.

~~~bash
git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu
~~~

when it is finnished downloading it, build it.

~~~bash
sudo make cleen install
~~~

### Patch

a more fun way to use Dmenu is by applying [patches](https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/) which are available on their site.

this is an example file, with some changes to fonts and colors.

~~~
/* See LICENSE file for copyright and license details. */
/* Default settings; can be overriden by command line. */

static int topbar = 1;                      /* -b  option; if 0, dmenu appears at bottom     */
static int centered = 0;                    /* -c option; centers dmenu on screen */
static int min_width = 500;                    /* minimum width when centered */
/* -fn option overrides fonts[0]; default X11 font or font set */
static const char *fonts[] = {
	"monospace:size=11"
};
static const char *prompt      = NULL;      /* -p  option; prompt to the left of input field */
static const char *colors[SchemeLast][2] = {
	/*     fg         bg       */
	[SchemeNorm] = { "#383A59", "#1E1F29" },
	[SchemeSel]  = { "#FAF9FA", "#383A59" },
	[SchemeOut]  = { "#000000", "#1E1F29" },
};
/* -l option; if nonzero, dmenu uses vertical list with given number of lines */
static unsigned int lines      = 0;
/* -h option; minimum height of a menu line */
static unsigned int lineheight = 22;
static unsigned int min_lineheight = 8;

/*
 * Characters not considered part of a word while deleting words
 * for example: " /?\"&[]"
 */
static const char worddelimiters[] = " ";

/* Size of the window border */
static const unsigned int border_width = 1;
